Since the goal requires opening an app (ChatGPT), and I don't have context, the first step is to launch the targeted app. I will assume a common package name for ChatGPT, like com.openai.chatgpt, or use a general launch if I don't know it, but launching by package is preferred. Since I don't have visible elements, I will proceed with launching what I assume is the ChatGPT app package.",
