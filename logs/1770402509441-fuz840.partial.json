I will assume the package name for ChatGPT is known or I need to search for it if launching fails. Since I see an app drawer button (though I should try launching directly first), I will try launching the app directly using a common package name structure if possible, or just assume it's not installed if the launch fails, but the prompt implies it should be available.\n\nSince I don't know the exact package name for ChatGPT, and I'm currently on a home screen or recent app screen that shows Google Search results/suggestions, the most robust way to open an app is using the 'launch' action. I'll try launching based on typical package names related to chat or AI like 'com.openai.chatgpt' or similar, or if that fails, I might have to go to the app drawer (tap 'Open App drawer' at [540, 2013]) and find it, but launching directly is preferred by the rules.",
