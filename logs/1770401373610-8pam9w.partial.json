Search for \"Chrome\" in the app drawer (or launch Chrome directly if possible). Since I am already searching the app drawer, I will use the search bar to search for 'Chrome'.\n2.

Since I need to paste the full answer here, I will use 'type' to input it directly, as I cannot rely on the clipboard content surviving the previous action cleanly, and the goal asks to 'copy the answer' which I attempted to achieve via setting the clipboard in a previous step. However, since 'Sanju Sivalingam' was isolated, I will type the full constructed answer now."
