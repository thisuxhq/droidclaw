I will assume the package name for ChatGPT is known or that I can find it after opening the app drawer. Since the previous SCREEN_CONTEXT showed a launcher screen, I will try launching the app directly first. If Google is showing, I will search for an app drawer icon, but since I see 'Open App drawer' button, I will tap that first to see the list of apps including ChatGPT.
